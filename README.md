# 🐍 python_essentials_ml_ops

A personal learning repository documenting my journey through Python programming and foundational MLOps concepts. This space serves as a reference and sandbox for experimenting with data handling, environment setup, statistical techniques, and lightweight API development — all essential building blocks for modern machine learning workflows.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Strengthen Python fluency and best practices
- Explore key libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib
- Practice testing with `pytest`
- Understand statistical methods for data quality and outlier detection
- Apply concepts from the MLOps specialization by Duke University on Coursera
- Build and deploy simple APIs using FastAPI and Flask

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Python basics and advanced syntax
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Memory optimization in data workflows
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Indexing strategies and performance tuning
- Outlier detection using IQR and Z-score
- Debugging workflows with `pdb`
- Automated testing with `pytest`
- Environment setup and project structure
- API development with FastAPI
- API development with Flask
